            ## 👋 Hi, I'm Gannon

            ![Gannon](images/me.jpg)

            - Works at Shopify
            - Committer on Ruby on Rails
            - [@gmcgibbon](https://github.com/gmcgibbon) on GitHub
            Note:
            Intro
            ---
            ## How my routing adventure started

            # 👨‍💻

            Note:
            - Tasked with moving routes
            - Moving routes ins't always easy
            - Reading the source of routing in Rails
            - Not of a lot of documentation on HOW it works
            ---
            ## Why learn about routing?

            - Frameworks inspire each other
            - You probably work with web technologies
            - Patterns and principles are language agnostic

            # 🤔

            Note:
            - You'll probably work with the web at some point
            - Web frameworks tend to borrow concepts
            - Rails is one of the most widely used web frameworks
            - Patterns and principles are language agnostic
            ---
            # How Rails routes requests
            ---
            ## Model View Controller (MVC)
            
            ```mermaid
            flowchart LR
              Client("👨‍💻")
              Model
              View
              Controller
              Client -- "Request" --> Controller
              Controller -- "Response" --> Client
              Controller -- "Queries" --> Model
              Model --> Controller
              Controller -- "Renders" --> View
              View --> Controller
            ```

            Note:
            - What is Model View Controller?
            - How MVC looks in Rails
            - Talk focuses on the C in MVC
            ---
            ## Controller-client interaction

            ```mermaid
            flowchart LR
              Client("👨‍💻")
              Controller
              Client -- "Request" --> Controller
              Controller -- "Response" --> Client
            ```

            Note:
            - Zoom in to Controller
            - Maybe MVC, maybe not
            - Another pattern in disguise
            ---
            ## Request-response model

            ```mermaid
            flowchart LR
              Client("👨‍💻")
              Server
              Client -- "Request" --> Server
              Server -- "Response" --> Client
            ```

            Note:
            - What is the Request-response model?
            - Maybe MVC, maybe not
            - Most web frameworks use these concepts
            ---
            ## What routes requests in Rails?
            
            ![Action Pack](images/actionpack.png)

            Note:
            - Rails is a collection of gems (libs)
            - Action Pack routes requests in Rails
            - Action Pack is a dependency of Rails
            - Provides controllers (the C in MVC)
            - Docs for Action Pack mainly on controllers
            ---
            ## Routing requests with Action Pack

            ```mermaid      
            stateDiagram-v2
              direction LR
              Request
              state Server {
                direction LR
                state "Web Server" as App {
                  direction LR
                  [*] --> Rack
                  Rack --> Router
                  Router --> Controller
                }
                [*] --> App
              }
              Request --> Server
              Controller --> [*]
            ```
            Note:
            - How a request gets from server to controller
            - Follow the diagram
            - Boxes will be explained
            ---
            ## Server

            - The physical machine
            - In a data center somewhere
            - Referred to as "the bare metal"

            ![Server](images/server.png)
            Note:
            - Physical machine that serves code
            - Probably in a data center somewhere
            - Called "the bare metal", but probably virtualized
            ---
            ## Web server

            - What actually hosts your app code
            - Plug and play
            - Puma by default in Rails

            ![Puma](images/puma.png)
            Note:
            - Hosts app code
            - Plug and play
            - Puma by default
            - Also Unicorn, Thin, WEBrick, etc.
            ---
            ## Rack

            - The bridge between web server and framework
            - Packages code into "apps" and "middleware"
            - Provides request and response objects
            - Used by other frameworks (Hanami, Sinatra, etc.)

            ![Rack](images/rack.png)
            Note:
            - Bridge between web server and framework
            - Deals in apps and middlewares
            - Provides request-response objects
            - Used by Rails, Hanami, Sinatra, and more
            ---
            ## Rack basics

            ```rb
            # config.ru
            class SomeMiddleware
              def initialize(app)
                @app = app
              end
              def call(env)
                @app.call(env)
              end
            end

            APP = proc do |_env|
              [200, { "Content-Type" => "text/plain" }, ["Hello World\n"]]
            end

            use(SomeMiddleware)
            run(APP)
            ```
            Note:
            - Explain code
            - Use for middleware, run for apps
            - Anything that responds to call
            ---
            ## Rack in Rails

            ```rb []
            # actionpack/actionpack.gemspec
            Gem::Specification.new do |s|
              s.name        = "actionpack"
              # ...
              s.add_dependency "activesupport", version
            
              s.add_dependency "nokogiri", ">= 1.8.5"
              s.add_dependency "rack",      ">= 2.2.4"
              s.add_dependency "rack-session", ">= 1.0.1"
              s.add_dependency "rack-test", ">= 0.6.3"
              s.add_dependency "rails-html-sanitizer", "~> 1.6"
              s.add_dependency "rails-dom-testing", "~> 2.2"
              s.add_dependency "actionview", version
              #...
            end
            ```
            Note:
            - Action Pack is a dependency of Rails
            - Explain gemspecs
            - Explain code
            ---
            ## Rack in Rails

            ```rb [8]
            # actionpack/actionpack.gemspec
            Gem::Specification.new do |s|
              s.name        = "actionpack"
              # ...
              s.add_dependency "activesupport", version
            
              s.add_dependency "nokogiri", ">= 1.8.5"
              s.add_dependency "rack",      ">= 2.2.4"
              s.add_dependency "rack-session", ">= 1.0.1"
              s.add_dependency "rack-test", ">= 0.6.3"
              s.add_dependency "rails-html-sanitizer", "~> 1.6"
              s.add_dependency "rails-dom-testing", "~> 2.2"
              s.add_dependency "actionview", version
              #...
            end
            ```
            Note:
            - Rack is a dependency of Action Pack
            - Explain version contraints
            - Everything is just gems
            ---
            ## Middleware in Rails

            ```txt []
            > bin/rails middleware
            use Webpacker::DevServerProxy
            use Rack::MiniProfiler
            use ActionDispatch::HostAuthorization
            use Rack::Sendfile
            use ActionDispatch::Static
            use ActionDispatch::Executor
            use ActiveSupport::Cache::Strategy::LocalCache::Middleware
            use Rack::Runtime
            use Rack::MethodOverride
            # ...
            use Rack::ETag
            use Rack::TempfileReaper
            use ActionDispatch::Static
            run Some::Application.routes
            ```
            Note:
            - Middleware command
            - Read top to bottom
            - Lots of middleware in Rails servers
            - Gems and developers can add to the stack
            ---
            ## Rack Middleware

            ```rb
            # actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/static.rb
            module ActionDispatch
              class Static
                def initialize(app, path, index: "index", headers: {})
                  @app = app
                  @file_handler = FileHandler.new(
                    path, index: index, headers: headers,
                  )
                end

                def call(env)
                  @file_handler.attempt(env) || @app.call(env)
                end
              end
            end
            ```
            Note:
            - Introduce AD::Static`
            - It serves static files from the public dir
            - Error pages like 404 are good examples
            ---
            ## Middleware in Rails

            ```txt [15]
            > bin/rails middleware
            use Webpacker::DevServerProxy
            use Rack::MiniProfiler
            use ActionDispatch::HostAuthorization
            use Rack::Sendfile
            use ActionDispatch::Static
            use ActionDispatch::Executor
            use ActiveSupport::Cache::Strategy::LocalCache::Middleware
            use Rack::Runtime
            use Rack::MethodOverride
            # ...
            use Rack::ETag
            use Rack::TempfileReaper
            use ActionDispatch::Static
            run Some::Application.routes
            ```
            Note:
            - Application routes is a rack app
            - Lots of middleware before app
            - The final step in routing a request
            ---
            ## The Rails router

            - The router code is private API
            - It may change in the future without notice
            - It pronbably won't though

            # ⚠️

            Note:
            - Action Pack internals are not public API
            - As a result, this is subject to change
            - I doubt it will change too much
            - !!! Some code simplified for slideshow
            ---
            ## The Rails router

            ```rb []
            # actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/route_set.rb
            class ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet
              def call(env)
                req = make_request(env)
                req.path_info = Journey::Router::Utils
                  .normalize_path(req.path_info)
                @router.serve(req)
              end
            end
            ```
            Note:
            - Rails.application.routes is a RouteSet
            - RouteSets respond to call
            - Explain code
            - The RouteSet object is the rack app
            ---
            ## The Rails router

            ```rb [7]
            # actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/route_set.rb
            class ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet
              def call(env)
                req = make_request(env)
                req.path_info = Journey::Router::Utils
                  .normalize_path(req.path_info)
                @router.serve(req)
              end
            end
            ```
            Note:
            - RouteSet forwards the request to the router
            ---
            ## The Rails router

            ```rb []
            # actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/journey/router.rb
            class ActionDispatch::Journey::Router
              def serve(req)
                find_routes(req).each do |match, parameters, route|
                  tmp_params = set_params.merge route.defaults
                  req.path_parameters = tmp_params
                  req.route_uri_pattern = route.path.spec.to_s
                  _, headers, _ = response = route.app.serve(req)
              
                  next if "pass" == headers[Constants::X_CASCADE]
                  return response
                end
                [404, { Constants::X_CASCADE => "pass" }, ["Not Found"]]
              end
            end
            ```
            Note:
            - This is the Rails Router
            - Explain code
            ---
            ## The Rails router

            ```rb [8]
            # actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/journey/router.rb
            class ActionDispatch::Journey::Router
              def serve(req)
                find_routes(req).each do |match, parameters, route|
                  tmp_params = set_params.merge route.defaults
                  req.path_parameters = tmp_params
                  req.route_uri_pattern = route.path.spec.to_s
                  _, headers, _ = response = route.app.serve(req)
              
                  next if "pass" == headers[Constants::X_CASCADE]
                  return response
                end
                [404, { Constants::X_CASCADE => "pass" }, ["Not Found"]]
              end
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - App can be a few things
            - Typically a dispatcher
            - Dispatches the controller

            ## Routing architecture
            
            ## O(n) vs O(1)

            ```rb
            # o(n) array
            array = (1..1000).map { Article.new(id) }
            array.find { |article| article.id == 45 }

            # vs o(1) hash
            hash = (1..10).map { |id| [id, Article.new(id)] }.to_h
            hash[45]
            ```

            Note:
            - Take a step back
            - Diff between O(n) vs O(1)
            - Array vs hash
            - Routes are basically a big array, at least in Rails

            ```

            Note:
            - Introduce command
            - Detects routes that map to a invalid controllers
            - Useful to reduce routes size

              blog      /blog(.:format)  Blog::Engine

            Routes for Blog::Engine:
            articles GET  /                       blog/articles#index
             article GET  /articles/:id(.:format) blog/articles#show
            ```
            Note:
            - Introduce command
            - Routes have priority
            - Evaluated in the order you define them
            - Priority matters, especially when moving routes
            - Engine line segway
            ---
            ## Modular routing
            
            - Engines can draw routes
            - App routes take priority over engines routes
            - Mounted, drawn, appended, or prepended

            # ⚙️

            Note:
            - Talk about engines
            - Devise, Active Storage etc.
            - Engines can draw routes
            - App routes first, then engine routes unusually
            - How engines can add routes to your application
            - Can be done via draw, append, prepend, or mount
            ---
            ## Routing with engines

             article GET  /articles/:id(.:format) blog/articles#show
            ```

            Note:
            - How engine routes can be mounted
            - Engine constants mount into app routes
            - Slower than other methods
            - Collisions are not possible
            - Priority is obvious

             article GET  /articles/:id(.:format) blog/articles#show
            ```

            Note:
            - How routes can be drawn onto app
            - Active Storage, for example
            - Fast, because it is all one RouteSet
            - Collisions are possible

             article GET  /articles/:id(.:format) blog/articles#show
            ```

            Note:
            - How routes can be appended onto app
            - Rails welcome page route, for example
            - Fast, because it is all one RouteSet
            - Collisions are possible
            - Priority is more obvious
            ---
            ## Routing with engines

            ```

            Note:
            - How routes can be prepended onto app
            - Rails internal info routes are an example of prepended routes
            - Fast, because it is still one RouteSet
            - Collisions are still possible
            - Priority is more obvious

            ## Route shadowing
            
            ```rb []
            # config/routes.rb
            Rails.application.routes.draw do
              get "*", to: "errors#404"
              root to: "application#index"
              resources :articles, only: %i(index show), module: :blog
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - Exaplin code
            - Exaplain why this doesn't work
            - Route priority will always choose the first route
            ---
            ## Route shadowing
            
            ```rb [3]
            # config/routes.rb
            Rails.application.routes.draw do
              get "*", to: "errors#404"
              root to: "application#index"
              resources :articles, only: %i(index show), module: :blog
            end
            ```

            # ❌

            Note:
            - The first route is too general
            - It should be moved to the bottom
            - Low priority routes can be more general
            ---
            ## Route shadowing
            
            ```rb
            # config/routes.rb
            Rails.application.routes.draw do
              root to: "articles#index"
              resources :articles, only: %i(index show), module: :blog
              get "*", to: "errors#404"
            end
            ```

            # ✅

            Note:
            - Moving the general route down fixes it
            - We can do more
            ---
            ## Route shadowing

            ```rb
            # config/routes.rb
            Rails.application.routes.draw do
              root to: "application#index"
              resources :articles, only: %i(index show), module: :blog
            end

            Rails.application.routes.append do
              get "*", to: "errors#404"
            end
            ```

            # ✅✅

            Note:
            - Could put it in an append block
            - Priority is easily maintained
            ---
            ## Route shadowing
            
            ```rb
            # config/routes.rb
            Rails.application.routes.draw do
              root to: "application#index"
              resources(:articles, only: %i(index show), module: :blog)
            end
            ```
            ```rb
            # blog/lib/engine.rb
            initializer("blog.error.routes") do |app|
              app.routes.append do
                get "*", to: "errors#404"
              end
            end
            ```

            # ✅✅✅

            Note:
            - Could put in an initializer
            - Less likely to change often
            - Less error prone
            ---
            ## Route shadowing
            
            ```rb
            # config/routes.rb
            Rails.application.routes.draw do
              root to: "application#index"
              resource(:articles, only: %i(show index))
              get "/login", to: "users#login"
              get "*", to: "application#404"
            end
            ```
            ```rb
            # admin/lib/engine.rb
            initializer("blog.error.routes") do |app|
              app.routes.append do
                get "*", to: "errors#404"
              end
            end
            ```
            ```rb
            # admin/config/routes.rb
            Rails.application.routes.draw do
              get "/login", to: "admins#login"
              resources(:users)
              get "users/send_email", to: "users#send_email"
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - More complex example
            - Much less clear at scale
            - 20+ engines, thousands of routes
            - Too difficult to change

            Note:
            - Explain tech debt
            - Relate it to my task
            - How can you pay tech debt?
            ---
            ## Write tests

            ```rb []
            # test/controllers/blog/articles_controller_test.rb
            class Blog::ArticlesControllerTest < AD::IntegrationTest
              test "#show routes to /blog/articles/:id" do
                assert_routing(
                  "/blog/articles/25",
                  controller: "blog/articles",
                  action: "show",
                  id: "25",
                )
              end
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - Test test test!
            - Routing assertions are built in to help
            - Explain assert_routing
            ---
            ## Write tests

            ```rb [5]
            # test/controllers/blog/articles_controller_test.rb
            class Blog::ArticlesControllerTest < AD::IntegrationTest
              test "#show routes to /blog/articles/:id" do
                assert_routing(
                  "/blog/articles/25",
                  controller: "blog/articles",
                  action: "show",
                  id: "25",
                )
              end
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - Explain the first arg (path)
            ---
            ## Write tests

            ```rb [6-8]
            # test/controllers/blog/articles_controller_test.rb
            class Blog::ArticlesControllerTest < AD::IntegrationTest
              test "#show routes to /blog/articles/:id" do
                assert_routing(
                  "/blog/articles/25",
                  controller: "blog/articles",
                  action: "show",
                  id: "25",
                )
              end
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - Explain the second argument (route hash)
            ---
            ## Integration vs Controller tests

            ```rb
            class ArticlesControllerTest < ActionController::TestCase
              test "#index" do
                get :show, params: { id: 25 }
              end
            end
            # vs
            class ArticlesControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
              test "#index" do
                get "blog/articles/25"
              end
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - Two different tests for controllers
            - Controller tests test controller actions
            - Uses the process entrypoint from earlier
            - Integration tests test paths
            - Uses Rack testing for end-to-end tests
            ---
            ## Integration vs Controller tests

            ```rb
            class ArticlesControllerTest < ActionController::TestCase
              test "#index" do
                get :show, params: { id: 25 }
              end

              test "#show routes to /blog/articles/:id" do
                assert_routing(
                  "/blog/articles/25",
                  controller: "blog/articles",
                  action: "show",
                  id: "25",
                )
              end
            end
            ```
            Note:
            - Both tests have routing assertions
            - Routing tests more important for controller tests
            - Controller tests are helpful, but have glaring flaws
            ---
            ## Integration vs Controller tests
            
            ```rb
            class ArticlesControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
              test "#index" do
                get "blog/articles/25"
              end
            end
            ```
            Note:
            - Integration tests are generated by default
            - Use integration tests, if you can
            - Tests routing automatically
            ---
            ## Summary

            - Rails apps are just big Rack apps
            - Draw less routes, it is faster
            - Write tests, refactor safely
            
            Note:
            - Preamble about all the info shown
            - Higlight takeaways
            - Rails apps are rack apps
            - Draw less routes
            - Please write tests
